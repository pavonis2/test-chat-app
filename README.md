# React + Firebase Chat App 
**live demo: [Chat App](https://chat-e0854.firebaseapp.com/)**

This project is built with React and Firebase Chat App.

Chat app is a real-time chat application where the user can chat with another user. This app supports email authentication that means user can signup with a new email and password and have that as your login credentials. The user can add other users who are registered on the app by searching for them with their username. User can send messages(text and emojis) to each other & share images. User can delete and edit said messages and images. After adding them to your chats, the user can see other user's information such as profile and user's online status. The unread messages from another user is highlighted in your chats section. Similar to WhatsApp messages load in batches, where to see older messages you have to scroll down for the next set of older messages to load in. All of these updates and changes happen in real time. So go to Chat App and enjoy chatting with people!!!
